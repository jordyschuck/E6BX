# E6-BX

// Short History //

The E6-B was first invented by U.S Navy Lt. Philip Dalton in 1930. The name of the E6-B comes from its original part number in the U.S Army Air Corps. 

The first model, the model-B, had a true airspeed and altitude correction circular slider. In 1936 a double drift diagram was added to the back side for the U.S Army Air Corps under the E series: E-1, E-1A, and E1-B.

Later the Mark IV was created for use in both the military and airlines. And the current model we know today, the E-6B was really just an arbitrary part number paired with its production number. The tool would later see mass production after Pearl Harbor, where the tool would glow under black light to be used in cockpits.

This python tool utilizes a streamlit front end paired with a python backend. All of the tools found on the E6-B can be found on this application.
